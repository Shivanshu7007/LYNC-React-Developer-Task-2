## MY Drive Application
## Overview:
The Online Drive application is a web-based file management system designed to mimic the functionalities of popular cloud storage services like Google Drive. It allows users to create, delete, and rename files and folders, browse through the file structure, and manage their data efficiently. The application is built using React and utilizes advanced React hooks and custom hooks for state management and component logic.

## Key Features:
## Browsing and Creating: Users can create new files and folders, browse through existing folders by double-clicking on them, and easily navigate the file structure.
## Deleting and Renaming: Users can delete existing files or folders and rename them as needed to organize their data effectively.
## Preventing Duplicate Creation: The application implements logic to prevent duplicate file and folder creation, ensuring data integrity and enhancing the user experience.
## Sidebar Navigation: A sidebar is integrated into the application to display folders and files, enabling intuitive navigation within the file system.
## Breadcrumbs and Back Button: Breadcrumbs are implemented with a back button to allow users easy navigation within the file structure.

## Usage Guide:
To use the Online Drive application, follow these instructions:
Navigation: Use the sidebar to navigate through folders and files. Double-click on a folder to open it and view its contents.
File Management: Right-click on a file or folder to access options for renaming or deleting it. Use the "Create" button to add new files or folders to the current directory.
Breadcrumbs and Back Button: Use the breadcrumbs at the top of the page to track your current location within the file system. Click on a breadcrumb to navigate directly to that folder. Use the back button to return to the previous folder.
