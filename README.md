## MY Drive Application
## Overview:
The Online Drive application is a web-based file management system designed to mimic the functionalities of popular cloud storage services like Google Drive. It allows users to create, delete, and rename files and folders, browse through the file structure, and manage their data efficiently. The application is built using React and utilizes advanced React hooks and custom hooks for state management and component logic.

## Key Features:
## Browsing and Creating: Users can create new files and folders, browse through existing folders by double-clicking on them, and navigate the file structure with ease.
## Deleting and Renaming: Users can delete existing files or folders and rename them as needed to organize their data effectively.
## Preventing Duplicate Creation: The application implements logic to prevent duplicate file and folder creation, ensuring data integrity and enhancing the user experience.
## Sidebar Navigation: A sidebar is integrated into the application to display folders and files, enabling intuitive navigation within the file system.
## Breadcrumbs and Back Button: Breadcrumbs are implemented along with a back button to provide users with easy navigation within the file structure.

## Setup Instructions:
